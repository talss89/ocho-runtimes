# ocho-runtimes

This project is a fork of the excellent [Bitpoke `stack-runtimes`](https://github.com/bitpoke/stack-runtimes) repository, for use with Ocho.

This fork intends to implement the following changes, which diverge from the Bitpoke project:

- [ ] Native aarch64 and amd64 images
- [ ] Moves the HTTP server to a separate container
- [ ] Dev container support
- [ ] Devspace support
- [ ] Built via GH actions
